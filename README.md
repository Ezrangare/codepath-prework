Project I would like to work on:
    An app to connect people looking to learn with individuals willing to share knowledge in real-time, casual conversations.It will bridge the gap between formal education platforms and the everyday wisdom and experiences that individuals worldwide can offer. Unlike traditional tutoring or educational platforms, the app will emphasize shared experiences, storytelling, and personal insights.
